# GameHub

In this project, I've implemented a small, but useful and really fast working React Application that is used to show brand new computer games to users.

Deploy is working on [Vercel](https://game-c6vnbm3y0-anteks-projects-8a0ca6ca.vercel.app/)

Have fun!

## Technology Stack

During the development process, I've used several front-end JS technologies:

- **React**, probably the best JS library ever
- **React Query**, powerful stuff for React.js development
- **Chakra UI** as a basic component library which allows quickly adding and styling all needed UI components
- **Infinite Scroll**, which allows the user to open more and more content on the page
- **Change Theme Button**

## How to use

1. Clone this repo to your PC:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```

2. Get an API key from RAWG
3. Create a .env file with your Key and Base API URL
4. Start an app using: 
```bash
npm run dev
```
